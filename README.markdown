# Decommissioned #

This code is no longer used to generate nightly.mozilla.org. That domain has become a simple redirect to the [Firefox Nightly page on www.mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly). Please [file an issue on the bedrock project](https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/issues/new) if you notice any problems or needed changes on that site.

# Nocturnal #

Nocturnal is a simple Python scraper script that crawls Mozilla's Nightly
FTP folders to build [nightly.mozilla.org][nightly].
This repo contains all the resources to build all Nightly pages.

You'll need to run the scraper script from a machine with an Internet
connection.

## Setup ##

Make sure you grab all the submodules.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/mozilla/nocturnal.git

## Usage ##

Specify an output directory (it shouldn't be the same directory as the
repo) and allow a few seconds for the script to scrape Mozilla's FTP
server.

    ./scrape.py --output-dir html

## Deploy ##

To deploy nocturnal to [nightly.mozilla.org][nightly], you'll need to
[file a bug in Bugzilla][bug template] under "Server Operations".

You can [use this bug template][bug template] to file a deploy bug. Easy!

You only need to get IT to deploy if you've changed the code; the
`scrape.py` command is run every hour.
